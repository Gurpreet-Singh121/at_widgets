# at_location_flutter

## Introduction

A flutter package to share and receive location between two atsigns.

## Get Started:

Initially to get a basic overview of the SDK, you must read the [atsign docs](https://atsign.dev/docs/overview/).

> To use this package you must be having a basic setup, Follow here to [get started](https://atsign.dev/docs/get-started/setup-your-env/).


### Installation:

 To use this library in your app, add it to your pubspec.yaml

```dart 
  dependencies:
    at_location_flutter: ^3.0.2
```

#### Add to your project

 ```dart
 flutter pub get 
 ```

 #### Import in your application code

 ```dart
 import 'package:at_location_flutter/at_location_flutter.dart';
 ```

### Clone it from github

 Feel free to fork a copy of the source from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets)

### Initialising:
It is expected that the app will first authenticate an atsign using the Onboarding widget.

The location service needs to be initialised with a required GlobalKey<NavigatorState> parameter for
navigation purpose (make sure the key is passed to the parent [MaterialApp]), the rest being optional parameters.

```dart
await initializeLocationService(
      navKey,
      mapKey: 'xxxx',
      apiKey: 'xxxx',
      showDialogBox: true,
      streamAlternative: (__){},
      isEventInUse: true, 
    );
```

As this package needs location permission, so add these for:

IOS: (ios/Runner/Info.plist)

```
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Explain the description here.</string>
```

Android: (android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

### Usage

To share location with an atsign for 30 minutes:
```
sendShareLocationNotification(receiver, 30);
```

To request location from an atsign:
```
sendRequestLocationNotification(receiver);
```

To view location of atsigns:
```
AtLocationFlutterPlugin(
  ['atsign1', 'atsign2', ...]
)
```

To use the default map view:
```
Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
          builder: (context) => MapScreen(
                currentAtSign: AtLocationNotificationListener().currentAtSign,
                userListenerKeyword: locationNotificationModel,
              )),
    );
```

To use the default home screen view:
```
Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (BuildContext context) => HomeScreen(),
    ));
```

Different datatypes used in the package:
```
 - LocationNotificationModel: Contains the details of a share/request location and is sent to atsigns while sharing / requesting.
 - LocationDataModel: Gets transferred in the background, contains the actual geo-coordinates and other details.
 - KeyLocationModel - The package uses this to keep a track of all the share/request notifications.
```
