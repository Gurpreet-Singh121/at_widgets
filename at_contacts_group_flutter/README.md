# at_contacts_group_flutter

## Introduction

A Flutter plugin project to provide group functionality with contacts using @â€Žplatform.

## Get Started:

Initially to get a basic overview of the SDK, you must read the [atsign docs](https://atsign.dev/docs/overview/).

> To use this package you must be having a basic setup, Follow here to [get started](https://atsign.dev/docs/get-started/setup-your-env/).

### Installation:

 To use this library in your app, add it to your pubspec.yaml

``` 
  dependencies:
    at_contacts_group_flutter: ^3.1.2
```
#### Add to your project

 ```dart
 flutter pub get 
 ```
 #### Import in your application code

 ```dart
 import 'package:at_contacts_group_flutter/at_contacts_group_flutter.dart';
 ```
### Clone it from github

 Feel free to fork a copy of the source from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_widgets)

### Initialising:

It is expected that the app will first create an AtClientService instance and authenticate an atsign.

The groups service needs to be initialised with the `atClient` from the `AtClientService`, current atsign and the root server.

```
initializeGroupService(
        clientSdkService.atClientServiceInstance.atClient, currentAtSign,
        rootDomain: MixedConstants.ROOT_DOMAIN);
```

### Usage

Navigating to the groups list is done simply by using:
```
Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (BuildContext context) => GroupList(),
    ));
```

## Example

We have a good example with explanation in the [at_contacts_group_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/at_contacts_group_flutter/example) package.
