## [at_notify_flutter] example
The [at_notify_flutter] package is designed to handle notifications in @protocol apps.

## How it works

Like most applications built for the  @â€Žplatform, we start with the [at_onboarding_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_flutter) widget which handles secure management of secret keys for an atsign as cryptographically secure replacement for usernames and passwords.

We use the [Onboarding()] widget in our [main.dart] and navigate to our [second_screen.dart] after successfully onboarding.

If you want to remove any already paired atsign, use the `Clear paired atsigns` button, it will remove all the paired atsigns for this example package.

As the [at_notify_flutter] package has to be initialised, so we initialise it in the [init()] of `second_screen.dart` by calling
```dart
    initializeNotifyService(
      atClientManager,
      activeAtSign!,
      atClientPreference,
      rootDomain: MixedConstants.ROOT_DOMAIN,
    );
```

The [second_screen.dart] consists of the following functions:
 - @atsign - Type in the receiver atsign.
 - Enter message - Type in the message.
 - Notify Text - Send the typed in message to the atsign. If you want to use this functionality then call [notifyText()] with the required parameters.
 - Get past notifications - Navigate to a new screen, to see past notifications of the selected number of days. I you want to use this functionality then navigate to the [NotifyService()] screen.
